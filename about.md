Hi
I am E. Aakash

I am currently working as Software Engineer in Honeywell Connected Enterprise. I completed B.Tech. in mechanical engineering with mninor in computer science engineering from IIT Bombay.

I am interested in and exploring containerization technologies, like docker & lxc, and learning orchestration (yes, K8s!)

I love open source software, and have contributed to [Terasology](https://terasology.org/), an open source voxel world game
